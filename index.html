	<p> Today I made my own web-page for CSE 199. </p>

  <p> It has a nice title... </p>

  <h2>A Nice Title</h2>

  <h3> a heading... </h3>

  <h3> a paragraph about myself...</h3>

  <p> Hi. My name is Aaron Lin. I am 18 years old.I am a computer science
  student studying at the University at Buffalo. I enjoy playing sports
  like football and I also enjoy working out. The following lines are irrelevant
  but this has to look like a real paragraph about myself. It's a nice day
  out today. It is a bit chilly though. I should do my fasfa later today...
  I'm also kinda hungry. I hope my computer updated and fixed itself by now...
  I think I will ask my friend after class to grab something to eat. My fingers
  still hurt from playing guitar. Learning how to play is a lot harder than I
  expected. CSE 199 is about to end soon... I'll stop here for now. </p>

  <h3> and an unordered list of my favorite activities... </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Computers</li>
    <li>Games</li>
    <li>Having Fun</li>
    <li>Friends</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>TV & Movies</li>
</ul>

Oh wait actually, my teacher really likes cats so I should add a cat.
